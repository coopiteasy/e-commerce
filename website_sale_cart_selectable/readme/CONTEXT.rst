Odoo allows you to set products as unpublished, effectively disallowing people
from buying these products. However, a company may want to publish a product
online to allow a customer to view the product, but NOT allow the customer to
purchase the product.

This module addresses that need by adding a toggle for the display of the 'Add
to cart' button.
